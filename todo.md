## Where to find everything
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
